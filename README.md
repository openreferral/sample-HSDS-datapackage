# sample-data

This repository contains a simple example set of Open Referral data using [the HSDS 1.1 Specification](http://docs.openreferral.org).

You can [preview it here](http://data.okfn.org/tools/view?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fopenreferral%2Fsample-data%2Fmaster%2Fsimple%2Fdatapackage.json).

This demonstrates how data can be packaged as a collection of CSV files, accompanied by a datapackage.json based on the template provided [in the HSDS repository](https://github.com/openreferral/specification).

This example uses fictional data, and only a limited sub-set of the full range of fields available in HSDS. 

An [earlier 1.0 release can be found here](https://github.com/openreferral/sample-data/tree/1.0).
